9 December 2013Fellow South AfricansLadies and gentlemen of the mediaWelcome to this briefing on 9 December 2013 a day before the National Memorial Service for the late President Nelson Mandela will be held at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. This is also a day on which we are welcoming a growing number of international leaders to South Africa.Since we are briefing media, let me start by thanking the media for the patience you showed yesterday when you had to wait in long queues for accreditation at the Nasrec Expo Centre.We appreciate the understanding many of you showed as we managed an unprecedented inflow of visitors over a short period of time. Accreditation helps us extend the necessary courtesies to guests and allows us to secure people and venues.We are doing our best to make it as comfortable and productive for journalists to cover this significant event in our country, and we will keep you updated on media logistics throughout this period.Most of the problems have been ironed out and by 5am today morning, we had issued permits to more than 1 500 media professionals.THANK YOU FOR YESTERDAY S DAY OF PRAYER AND REFLECTIONAs government, we want to thank South Africans and our friends and partners around the world for the overwhelming response yesterday to President Jacob Zuma s call for the day to be observed with prayer and reflection.We saw yesterday how people from all walks of life came together in villages, towns and global cities around the world to celebrate Madiba s life.Memorial events were staged in Bryanston, Khayelitsha and Tshwane, but also at Mbazwana, Grahamstown and Motherwell.People came together in KwaDukuza, at a Hare Krishna temple in Chatsworth and shared their love for Madiba in Addis Ababa, Harare, London and Sydney.We view this as Madiba s legacy living on in the lives and values of people all over the world.In South Africa his legacy lives on in our democratic dispensation and in the positive changes we have seen in the quality of life in our country, and in our engagement with the world.Madiba s legacy lives on in our commitment to ensure a just and fair society for all.Madiba s legacy to the country and the world will no doubt be the focus of today s special Joint Sitting of Parliament where the country s political leadership will reflect on the life and contribution of Nelson Mandela.We expect that this sitting where members of the public will be special guests will demonstrate that President Mandela s vision and principles remain the guiding light for South Africa in 2013 and the years ahead.In this briefing, we d like to touch on a few key points that cover today and tomorrow:INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALSBy noon today (Monday) 91 Heads of State and Government and 10 former heads had confirmed that they would attend the National Memorial Service at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg, tomorrow.Kings, queens, princes and princesses will be joined at FNB Stadium by representatives of international organisations such as the United Nations, African Union, European Union, the Commonwealth and the World Bank, and other VIPs.At least 70 sitting and 10 former Heads of State and Government and have confirmed their attendance of the National Memorial Service at FNB Stadium tomorrow, Tuesday, December 10, or other memorial events.We extend a warm South African welcome to all leaders, eminent persons and delegations who are making their way to South Africa to be with us at this time of mourning and celebration.Government has advised visiting leaders to attend the National Memorial Service in Johannesburg in preference to President Mandela s burial in Qunu. This is view of the logistical challenges of hosting large delegations of VVIPs and VIPs in a village such as Qunu.The Department of International Relations and Cooperation is continuously updating the list of confirmed VVIPs and VIPs on social media, and information is being posted on www.mandela.gov.za and other government sites.The Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) has put measures in place to handle the influx of visitors.The company s operations team has already activated a number of controls to ensure smooth facilitation of passengers during this time.Capacity at the two airports is as follows: O.R. Tambo International AirportHourly runway capacity (air traffic movements) 62Annual passenger handling capacity 28 millionPublic parking bays 16 300 East London AirportHourly runway capacity (air traffic movements) 30Annual passenger handling capacity 1,2 millionPublic parking bays 550 Temporary infrastructure has been created at East London Airport to handle more than the 2 000 passengers per day that the airports currently facilitates.Extra staff has been assigned to help with additional services.Engagements between airports, airlines, ground-handling companies, government and law enforcement agencies are currently underway to ensure smooth processing.Due to the expected increase in traffic and passenger volumes, flow restrictions as it applies to air traffic movements have been imposed, which includes parking restrictions for arriving aircraft.Both scheduled and non-scheduled airlines will need to park in either a pre-arranged hangar or, divert to another facility.Given Airports Company South Africa s expertise at managing significant increases in local and international passenger numbers, the company is confident that it can handle any operational challenges that it may be faced with during this period.

This will be the first of three days on which mourners will be able to file past the President s casket in the Union Buildings amphitheatre.Mourners will be transported by shuttle to Union Buildings from the Pretoria Showgrounds in the west of the city during the course of each day.On Wednesday 11 December 2013, the President s body will be transported along a memorial route from 1 Military Hospital, Thaba Tshwane, to the Union Buildings.Once the casket is prepared for viewing, members of the Mandela family and various national and international dignitaries will view the late President from 10am to 12 noon.Members of the public will be brought to the venue between 12 noon and 5.30 pm.Members of the public will be taken to the Union Buildings by shuttle from the Pretoria Showgrounds.No cameras will be allowed and cellphones will need to be switched off and out of sight.Mourners will be expected to keep moving past the casket, without pausing. This is to ensure that as many people as possible get to pay their last respects.In this way, it is expected that up to 2 000 people could file past the casket each hour.Visitors will only be permitted to pay their respect once.To make sure this happens, security personnel will mark each mourner's thumb/finger nail with the same indelible ink that is used during the voting process.On Thursday and Friday, the late President s cortege will leave 1 Military Hospital at 7am and public viewing at the Union Buildings will proceed between 8am and 5.30pm.Details of the memorial route will be announced after tomorrow s National Memorial Service at FNB Stadium.Again, we want to emphasise that all the key events, including the lying-in-state will be broadcast live and people will therefore be able to follow these events from remote sites.SAFETY OF CHILDREN AT PUBLIC EVENTSThe Department of Social Development has made the following request to secure the safety of children under the age of 8 at major public events:Parents taking children to such events must write their the parents cellphone numbers in permanent marker ink on the inside of children s forearms.There are always instances of lost children at big events and this is very traumatic for the children and parents or guardians, and it is time-consuming for police and social workers.INFORMATION RESOURCESPeople who are at work or travelling during this period can visit the South African Broadcasting Corporation website www.sabc.co.za - or the official government memorial website www.mandela.gov.za - to follow the SABC s 24-hour live webstream.For information about arrangements at the various events and sites around the country, we ask people to use the various government websites- including those of provincial and local government and to follow us on social media.Some of the key sites to use are:ENQUIRIESPhumla Williams Acting Government Spokesperson Cell: 083 5010 139Issued by Government Communication and Information and System (GCIS)
