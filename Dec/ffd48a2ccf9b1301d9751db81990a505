 11 December 2013Government wants to advise members of the public that the cut-off has been reached for people wishing to view President Mandela s body at the Union Buildings this afternoon. Large numbers of people are still in queues at the various points around the City of Tshwane from which mourners are being transported to the Union Buildings. Government welcomes the interest people have showed in wanting to bid Madiba farewell, but we have reached the limit for the day. The main park-and-ride points from which people are being shuttled to the Union Buildings are the Tshwane Events Centre, or Tshwabac, and the LC de Villiers sports complex in Hatfield. The Fountains Valley park-and-ride site is an overflow point, from which visitors are transferred to the Events Centre or LC de Villiers, where they are prepared for the visit to the Union Buildings. Organising authorities appeal to people to be patient. Government is trying to accommodate as many people as possible. For this to happen, visitors must comply with the very strict military protocols that govern the lying-in-state. Mourners must set out from home early in the morning and be prepared to wait in line. Government appeals for calm and decency in cases where people are turned away, as the protocol dictates that viewing is from 8am to 5.30pm. Organisers will stop loading people onto buses at about 4-4.30pm. No identity documents or accreditation is required for this event. Children are welcome to join their parents but parents must use the necessary discretion, as the event can be emotional for some adults or children.
